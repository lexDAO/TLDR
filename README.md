# The lexDAO Registry ✒️ TLDR
> Transactional Scripts for Legal and Ethereal Deal Security

TLDR is an interactive registry and market on Ethereum that allows anyone to select curated "lexScripts" for two main types of transactions:

(1) **Digital Dollar Retainers (DDR)**, and (2) **Digital Covenants (DC)**

From our initial observations, we believe that blockchain-enabled deals primarly fall into these categories and present immediate opportunities for utilizing transactional scripts (or, *smart contracts*) to scope out efficiency gains.

## DDR

DDRs are essentially escrow transactions that support any ERC-20 digital token, where the public can initalize and record unique deal terms and then have the TLDR act as escrow agent and arbiter of their deal for a given *registered digital dollar retainer*.

DDRs can be one-off transactions or *by deliverable* over a set duration for a set rate. Each DDR therefore has a *pay cap* that acts as a hard limit for the ERC-20 *digital dollar* amount escrowed in TLDR and paid under the deal as well as a *duration* timer that will release the escrow remainder to the paying *client* after termination.

## DC

DCs can be pledges, representations and/or warranties that Ethereum accounts might want to sign and associate around in order to access DAOs or other digital communities with participation rules. DC signatures can be revoked at will by each signatory, and are separately recorded for public inspection as *registered digital convenants*.

## TLDR lexDAO Governance

TLDR is maintained by lexScribes who admit each other as *lexDAO* participants. In order to boost lexScript contributions and good stewardship of related disputes, TLDR implements a minimal DAO design inspired by Manuel Araoz *[digital violence](https://maraoz.com/2019/02/11/digital-life/)*, wherein, participants police each other's reputation points and can effectively *disbar* or kill off unruly lexScribes from their digital association.

Ether and LEX tokens (minted from TLDR service, lexScripts and arbitration) may be staked for lexDAO reputation points within different "cooldown" periods. 

### Crypto-Economics 

To incentivize quality contributions to TLDR, each DDR that imports a lexScript will pay the requested fee of the author lexScribe. 

For example, a DDR with a deliverable rate of "500 DAI" might pay 5 DAI on TLDR transactions to satisfy a "lexRate" of 1% ("100" as set within script).

### Arbitration

Reputable lexScribes within lexDAO are also able to resolve DDR disputes and claim a set 5% arbitration fee of the remaining DDR escrow for such TLDR service, offering more opportunities for lexDAO sustainability.
